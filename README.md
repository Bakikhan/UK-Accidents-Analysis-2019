# UK-Accidents-Analysis-2019

The government agencies are analysing road accidents data to determine the best way to
improve and develop road safety standards. All the accidents involving vehicles and causalities
are logged in the United Kingdom. The government primarily identifies a report related with
the probabilities of non-fatal accidents every year.
The purpose of the project is to make recommendations to government authorities on how to
interpret the data and anticipate the number of accidents and injuries that caused in the year
2019. By building and estimating the model, the road safety can be established, and the
upcoming circumstances of accidents can be avoided.
